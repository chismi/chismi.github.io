					<p class="P3">Lander was at the wheel, Rex in the passenger seat. While Lander cruised, his eyes shifting over the road ahead, Rex lounged in his chair. The windows were rolled up and air poured out of the vents over Rex's coat. He held the grin he usually held because he knew a lot of things no one else did. His eyes were low and the bristles of his coat raised, lowered, spit, and flowed under the weight of the ventilation system. Lander was in and out of sharpness. His head occasionally clouded, buzzed, and stiffened to close his eyes and sink into a dream, then he would stir and was awake until it happened again. He cherished his dreams; he would visit the most incredible places--landscapes and structures and structures that blended into landscapes--offering a bridge between what could make one feel small and wonder at the strength of nature and what could make one feel small and wonder at the strength of man.</p><p class="P3">
He had to learn to love the scary dreams, the ones he didn't want to return to after he woke up. They involved curious situations and characters that might have been depraved or misleading, but had seen more than anyone. He used to wake up from these dreams at one character's whisper or another's scream and he would feel safe when he tucked his feet under his covers until he sweat and sweat and had to push them out. Then he would watch the figures in his room become the characters in his dreams. They just wanted to reach him. 
One night he woke up as the chair next to his bed with the sweater dripping off the back leaned over to him. It was a short thing balancing on one leg with its hand outstretched, tipping until it rested on that hand and looked up to him. Normally he would have turned away and tucked in his feet--tucked in everything--until his chair toppled over to tell him: of course it was a chair. But this time he looked at it. He stared at it straight on an watched it catch itself and look up at him. He studied the figure as its coat began to shine and its eyes opened. He watched as it swung an arm from where the fourth leg of the chair would have been around to touch him. Lander offered his hand to meet the figure. It was warm, with fingers that slipped between his, and he pulled from his bed to allow the thing to stand. He could see a face now, almost human, or maybe it once was, and it grinned. It knew a lot of things no one else did.</p> 
<p class="P3">Lander watched the road, and he watched a pair of headlights run the direction opposite his. They rose up from a hill to look at him. The dotted yellow line skipped beside Lander's truck and Lander started to tug the wheel just a little. The truck eased into the other lane, first one wheel, then two and Lander watched the headlights. The evening shadows stretched allowing small bushes and tufts of grass to blend together as Rex relaxed his eyes. The headlights rose closer and Lander stared into them. He saw smoke pour from the other vehicle's tires and heard their screech and struggle to stop. On impact his hood buckled and coursed as his windows shattered. The dashboard fractured and his truck rose, twisted, and rolled over the passenger side. The crash tore, crushed, then sighed, as it made a million from one. 
Rex told the authorities that Lander had fallen asleep with a heavy arm. They had pulled him from the wreck, and and agreed it was a spectacular display of deconstruction. The impact must have leveraged every mode and angle of force on the vehicle as it left almost no coherent trace of Lander's truck. His body had been pinned by the steering column against the driver-side door and he breathed gently, still asleep, when they unfolded him from the cabin.</p> 
<p class="P3">He stayed in the hospital, bound to the position they had set him but his sprawling form was somehow destined to function once more. Rex sat by Lander's side, arms crossed, comfortable in his fur. He took the television control to set the channel and adjust the volume loud enough to fill the room and he mouthed the words to advertisements he knew. Rex didn't sleep; when Lander slept, he set about his movements. He tried all the locked doors and closets, checked the rehabilitation hallway for stray medicine balls, and generally took stock of the institution. Then, he left the hospital altogether. It wasn't his job but Rex had long ago taken it upon himself to spend some time out and about.</p>
<p class="P3">He started along the road outside the hospital. The street shined under scattered lamps and vehicles hissed on the damp road beside him. As he strolled along the shoulder a light fog matted his fur. After some time he came to what he was looking for. It pushed out of the trees dripping onto one another from a depth they guarded to the slope of the road. Its front shone ruby red in a nearby lamp, then flew up out of the light, split by windows and ornament, into a peak that hung in the air. Rex ran his paw out to the metal fence that followed the structure from the trees, around the front, and back in. He began to trace it toward the woods. 
Just where the bushes took hold of the fence, a piece of support piping had slid from the ground and lifted an opening in the wires. There he knelt and pulled himself inside. He stood to face the frame of an entrance and stared on until its features resolved out of the dark. It was a large orifice arched into the building's side over a short set of steps. In the opening he found several wooden panels bound together to fill it. As Rex stood, he rose to a third of the feature's height and he lowered his gaze to its threshold while the fog that coalesced on his coat fell to wet the surface of his skin.</p>
<p class="P3">He bent and reached behind him for the piece of piping that had escaped its hold in the ground. Tensing, he twisted, stood, and slung the pipe into the doorway's barriers that cracked into a narrow passage. He stepped inside.
